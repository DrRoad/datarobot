v2.4.0
-------

New features:

* The premium feature DataRobot Prime has been added. You can now approximate a model on the leaderboard and download executable code for it. Talk to your account representative if the feature is not available on your account. The new related functions are GetPrimeEligibility, RequestApproximation, ListPrimeModels, GetPrimeModel, GetRulesets, RequestPrimeModel, GetPrimeModelFromJobId, CreatePrimeCode, GetPrimeFileFromJobid, ListPrimeFiles, GetPrimeFile, DownloadPrimeCode
* A utility function, WaitForJobToComplete, has been added. It will block until the specified job finishes, or raise an error if it does not finish within a specified timeout.
* Functions SetupProjectFromMySQL, SetupProjectFromOracle, SetupProjectFromPostgreSQL and SetupProjectFromHDFS have been added. They allow user to create DataRobot projects from MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL and HDFS data sources.
* Functions RequestTransferrrableModel, DownloadTransferrableModel, UploadTransferrableModel, GetTransferrrableModel, ListTransferrrableModels, UpdateTransferrrableModel, DeleteTransferrrableModel have been added. They allow user to download models from modeling server and transfer them to special dedicated prediction server (those functions are only useful to users with on-premise environment)

Enhancements:
* An optional maxWait parameter has been added to GetModelFromJobId and GetFeatureImpactForJobId, to allow users to specify an amount of time to wait for the job to complete other than the default 60 seconds.
* Projects can now be run in quickrun mode (which skips some autopilot stages and longer-running models) by passing "quick" as the mode parameter, in the same way "auto" and "manual" modes can be specified.
* The client will now check the API version offered by the server specified in configuration, and  a warning if the client version is newer than the server version. The DataRobot server is always backwards compatible with old clients, but new clients may have functionality that is not implemented on older server versions. This issue mainly affects users with on-premise deployments of DataRobot.
* SetupProject and UploadPredictionDataset accept url as dataSource parameter now

Bugfixes:
* If a model job errors, GetModelFromJobId will now immediately raise an exception, rather than
  waiting for the timeout.
* The maxWait parameter on UploadPredictionDataset will now be correctly applied.

API Changes:

Deprecated and Defunct:
* The quickrun parameter on SetTarget is deprecated (and will be removed in 3.0). Pass "quick" as the mode parameter instead.

Documentation Changes:

v2.3.0
---------

Enhancements:
* When project creation using SetupProject times out, the error message now includes a URL to use with
  the new ProjectFromAsyncUrl function to resume waiting for the project creation.
* GetFeatureInfo now supports retrieving features by feature name. (For backwards compatibility,
  feature IDs are still supported until 3.0.)
* The package no longer a particular version of the methods package. (This dependecy was too strict and
  required some users to unnecessarily upgrade R.)
* The projectName argument of SetupProject no longer defaults to the string 'None'. (The new default is not
  to send a name, which results in the name 'Untitled Project'.)
* The maxWait argument for SetupProject now controls the timeout for the initial POST request and has a larger
  default value. The reason for this is that for large project creation file uploads, the server may take a
  longer-than-normal amount of time to respond, and waiting longer than the default timeout may be necessary.

Deprecated and Defunct:
* The ability to use GetFeatureInfo with feature IDs is deprecated (and will be removed in 3.0). Use
  feature names instead.
* GetRecommendedBlueprints is replaced by ListBlueprints and deprecated (and will be removed in 3.0). 
* RequestPredictions is deprecated and replaced by RequestPredictionsForDataset. RequestPredictionsForDataset will be
  renamed to RequestPredictions in 3.0.
* DeletePendingJobs is removed; use DeleteModelJob instead
* GetFeatures is removed; use ListModelFeatures instead
* GetPendingJobs is removed; use GetModelJobs instead
* StartAutopilot is removed; use SetTarget instead
* parameter url is removed from ConnectToDataRobot
* parameter jobStatus is removed from GetModelJobs
* parameters saveFile and csvExtension are removed from RequestPredictions
* parameters saveFile and csvExtension are removed from SetupProject
* "semi" mode option (functions SetTarget, StartNewAutoPilot) is deprecated (and will be removed in 3.0).

New features:
* The API now supports the new Feature Impact feature. Use RequestFeatureImpact to start a job to compute
  FeatureImpact, and GetFeatureImpactForModel or GetFeatureImpactForJobId to retrieve the completed Feature
  Impact results.
* The new functions CreateDerivedFeatureAsCategorical, CreateDerivedFeatureAsText, CreateDerivedFeatureAsNumeric
  can be used to create derived features as type transforms of existing features.
* The API now supports uploading (UploadPredictionDataset), listing (ListPredictionDatasets), and deleting 
  (DeletePredictionDataset) datasets for prediction as well as requesting predictions (RequestPredictionsForDataset) against
  such datasets.


Bugfixes
* as.data.frame fixed for empty listOfBlueprints, listOfFeaturelists, listOfModels
* The documentation for SetTarget incorrectly referred to the 'semiauto' (rather than 'semi') autopilot setting.
  This is fixed.
* GetPredictions previously used a maxWait of 60, regardless of what maxWait the user specified. This is fixed.


v2.2.33
-------

Bugfixes
* GetModelJobFromId was broken by v2.2.32 and is now fixed.
* CreateFeaturelist was broken by v2.2.32 and is now fixed.

v2.2.32
-------

API Changes
* Package renamed to `datarobot`.

New features:
* ListJobs and DeleteJob functions added. ListJobs lists the jobs in the
  project queue (of any type). DeleteJob can be used to cancel
  one of these jobs.
* ListFeatureInfo (for all features) and GetFeatureInfo (for one feature) have
  been added for retrieving feature details.

Enhancements:
* In line with new functionality in version 2.2 of the DataRobot API,
  CreateUserPartition now allows `holdoutLevel` to be NULL (which results in not
  sending the holdout level, in line with backend API changes to allow user
  partitions to be created without a holdout level).
* Slices using `[` from objects of type listOfBlueprints, listOfFeaturelists, and listOfModels will now
  retain the appropriate type.
* Several functions (e.g. ConnectToDataRobot, DeleteModel, PauseQueue, etc.) used
  to return TRUE as their only possible return value. Now they return nothing instead.
* GetValidMetrics no longer has special-casing for the situation when the project is
  not yet ready to give you the valid metrics for a potential metric. In this case,
  an error will now be returned from the server.
* Error messages from the server now include additional detail.
* To improve error messages, in several places error messages no longer reference
  the top-level function the user called.
* The SetTarget function will now properly block execution until the server indicates
  the project has finished initializing and is ready to build models

Deprecated and Defunct:
* GetFeatures has been deprecated and renamed to ListModelFeatures (for more
  more clarity/consistency in naming and to avoid confusion with the now GetFeatureInfo
  and ListFeatureInfo)
* Support for authenticating via username/password has been removed. Use an API
  Token instead
* Removed broken UpdateDefaultPartition. To use one of the default partition methods
  with updated settings, please use CreateRandomPartition or CreateStratifiedPartition.

v2.1.31
-------
Enhancements
* Use of the WaitForAutopilot function will no longer trigger deprecation
  warnings

v2.1.30
-------
Bugfixes
* Due to a dependency on the methods package (which is loaded by default interactively
  but not running Rscript), RequestPredictions did not work when invoked with Rscript. This
  is fixed. The methods package is now in 'depends' instead of 'imports' to prevent this
  problem from ever occurring again.

v2.1.29
-------
Deprecated & Defunct
* Removed broken UpdateDefaultPartition. Please use the other partition-creating functions.

v2.1.28
-------
Bugfixes
* Due to a dependency on the methods package (which is loaded by default interactively
  but not running Rscript), some functions did not work when invoked with Rscript. This
  is fixed.
* SetupProject and GetPredictions now check for and displays errors in
  project creation (previously they would keep waiting and time out if
  there are errors)
* Previously errors would sometimes appear missing a space between two words. This is fixed.

v2.1.27
-------
Bugfixes
* Fixed a problem that caused an error when getting predictions if the
  installed version of the httr package was 1.0 and older.

v2.1.26
-------
Enhancements:
* HTTP requests now include User-Agent headers for logging purposes,
  e.g. "DataRobotRClient/2.0.25 (Darwin 14.5.0 x86_64)".
* We now provide a more informative error message after receiving HTML
  from the server when we expected JSON.
* We avoid httr encoding warning messages by specifying UTF-8.
* It is now possible to not specify the desired jobStatus in GetPendingJobs
  (by passing NULL for the jobStatus argument, which is now the default).
* GetPredictions now checks whether a prediction job has errored or been
  canceled and will error right away in that case (instead of waiting
  until the timeout)
* When specifying the data source as a dataframe (in RequestPredictions
  or SetupProject), the class may now be a subclass of dataframe
  (it need not be equal to dataframe).
* Previously GetModelJobs returned a dataframe when there are jobs but
  an empty list when there are none. Now it consistently returns a
  dataframe (with zero rows if there are no jobs) either way.

New features:
* ConnectToDataRobot can now read from a YAML config file.
* On package startup, we look for a config file in the default
  location, so the user does not need to call ConnectToDataRobot
  explicitly
* WaitForAutopilot function added. This function periodically checks
  whether Autopilot is finished and returns only after it is.
* SetupProject and RequestPredictions now default to using a tempfile
  instead of placing the file to be uploaded into the current working
  directory.
* New function StartNewAutopilot can be used to restart autopilot on a
  specific featurelist if it was previously running on a different one.
* New function SetTarget provides the functionality that StartAutopilot
  used to be responsible for. StartAutopilot is now deprecated, and
  SetTarget should be used instead. This function can now take a
  featurelistId argument, specifying which featurelist to use.


Bugfixes:
* GetPendingJobs (now deprecated in favor of GetModelJobs) was broken
  and is now fixed.
* GetValidMetrics was broken and is now fixed.
* GetProjectList no longer errors when there are no projects. It now
  returns an object whose structure matches the returned object when
  there are projects.

Deprecated and Defunct:
* The arguments controlling where the tempfile goes (in SetupProject
  and RequestPredictions) are now deprecated
* DeletePendingJob is deprecated (use DeleteModelJob instead)
* GetPendingJob is deprecated (use GetModelJob instead)
* jobStatus argument to GetModelJob/GetPendingJob is deprecated (use
  status instead)
* StartAutopilot is deprecated (use SetTarget instead).

API Changes Summary:
* Support for the experimental date partitioning has been removed in
  DataRobot API, so it is being removed from the client immediately -
  the CreateDatePartition function has been removed.


v2.0.25
-------
Enhancements:
* Codebase cleaned of many lint violations.

New Features:
* DeletePredictJob, GetPredictJobs, GetPredictions, RequestPredictions
  all added to control the prediction functionality created in v2.0
  featureset of the API.
* "quickrun" parameter added to StartAutopilot. This boolean enables
  use of the quickrun autopilot feature of DataRobot.

Bugfixes:
None

Deprecated and Defunct:
None

API Changes:
None


v0.2.24
-------
* fixes the maxWait parameter that was unsuccessfully introduced in 0.2.23

v0.2.23
-------
* maxWait parameter added to SetupProject to allow for datasets that take very
  long to initialize on the DataRobot server

v0.2.22
-------
* Documentation structure changed to use Roxygen2
