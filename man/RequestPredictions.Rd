\title{Request predictions for model from newdata}
\usage{
RequestPredictions(model, newdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An S3 object of class dataRobotModel like that returned by
the function GetModelObject, or each element of the list returned by
the function GetAllModels.}

\item{newdata}{Either (a) the name of a CSV file or (b) a dataframe;
in either case, this parameter identifies the source of the data from which
all model predictions will be generated.  See Details.}
}
\value{
Integer predictJobId to be used by GetPredictions function to retrieve
the model predictions.
}
\description{
This function uploads the data source defined by newdata and
requests the predictions generated from this data source by
model.  The data source is specified in the same way as for
the function SetupProject and can be either a CSV file or a
dataframe containing the features on which model was built.
Note that this function only requests the predictions be
generated and returns a prediction job identifier to be used
by the GetPredictions function to retrieve the predictions
once they have been generated.
}
\details{
The DataRobot modeling engine requires a CSV file containing the data to be
used in generating predictions, and this has been implemented here in two ways.
The first and simpler is to specify dataSource as the name of this CSV file,
but for the convenience of those who wish to work with dataframes, this
function also provides the option of specifying a dataframe, which is then
written to a CSV file and uploaded to the DataRobot server. In this case, the
file name is either specified directly by the user through the saveFile
parameter, or indirectly from the name of the dataSource dataframe if
saveFile = NULL (the default).  In this second case, the file name consists
of the name of the dataSource dataframe with the string csvExtension appended.
